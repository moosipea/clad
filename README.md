# Clad

I've used the wonderful OpenGL loader [glad](https://github.com/Dav1dde/glad)
for a long time now and find it superb. I don't, however, like that it forces me to
use Python during the build process. For this reason, I've decided to build my
own OpenGL loader in C.

**NOTE:** If you actually need a good OpenGL loader, please just use glad!
